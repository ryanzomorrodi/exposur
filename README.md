Heavily inspired by
[`hurricaneexposure`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hurricaneexposure/).
This package is currently just for internal CEHI usage.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `exposur` like so:

``` r
# first download the stormwindmodel
pak::pkg_install("geanders/stormwindmodel")
# then install this package
pak::pkg_install("ryanzomorrodi/exposur")
```
