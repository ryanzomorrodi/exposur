Heavily inspired by `hurricaneexposure`. This package is currently just for my personal use.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `exposur` like so:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# first download the stormwindmodel
pak::install("geanders/stormwindmodel")
# then install this package
pak::install("ryanzomorrodi/exposur")
```
